# Rebuild SourceKit-LSP's flag database from a build log. Run by the VS Code build task; also the
# one-time editor setup, since it is what creates buildServer.json. See docs/development.md.
#
# `xcode-build-server parse` with no `-o` is deliberate: that is the only spelling that also writes
# buildServer.json, and it writes it as `kind: manual`. The `kind: xcode` alternative ignores .compile
# entirely and reads a cache scraped from .xcactivitylog instead — which silently freezes the moment
# LogStoreManifest.plist stops updating, pinning the editor to a source list from an old build.
